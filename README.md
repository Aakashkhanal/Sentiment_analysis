## 📖 About the Project

Sentiment Analysis is a key task in NLP that helps in understanding the opinion or emotion expressed in a piece of text. This project uses Twitter data to:

- Preprocess and clean tweet text.
- Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
- Train models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Deep Learning models.
- Evaluate and visualize the performance of sentiment classifiers.
